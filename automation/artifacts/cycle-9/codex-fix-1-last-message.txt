Failure root cause:
- The cycle runner seeded/reset state **before** explorer, but not after it.
- In cycle 9, explorer mutated DB state (including disabling the seeded organizer), then smoke tests ran on that dirty state.
- `organizer-profile-nav.smoke.spec.js` then failed at login with `403` (`Organizer account is disabled`), seen in `automation/artifacts/cycle-9/playwright/stdout.log` and corroborated by `automation/artifacts/cycle-9/codex-explorer.log`.

Fix implemented:
- Added a second deterministic reset immediately after explorer and before test execution in `automation/scripts/run_cycle.sh:168`.
- This ensures smoke/full suites always start from clean seed data, regardless of explorer side effects.

Files changed:
- `automation/scripts/run_cycle.sh`

Validation commands run:
1. `npm --prefix frontend run build`  
- Outcome: passed.
2. `npm --prefix backend run typecheck`  
- Outcome: passed.
3. `bash automation/scripts/run_playwright_suite.sh`  
- Outcome: failed in this sandbox due Playwright browser launch restriction (`sandbox_host_linux.cc:41 ... Operation not permitted`), not due app/test assertions.
4. `bash -n automation/scripts/run_cycle.sh`  
- Outcome: passed (script syntax valid).

**Validated Flows (Playwright MCP, deterministic checks)**
- `participant` auth:
  - Invalid login shows `Invalid credentials`.
  - Valid login redirects to `/participant`.
  - RBAC guard: visiting `/organizer` as participant redirects back to participant area.
- `participant` journeys:
  - Browse events filter behavior, including `followed clubs only` with zero follows -> empty result.
  - Event detail registration for normal event with required field.
  - Ticket generation and ticket-detail access (QR payload present).
  - My Events tab transitions: upcoming -> cancelled/rejected after cancellation.
  - Organizer follow/unfollow from Clubs/Organizers page.
  - Profile read-only fields (email/participant type) + password mismatch validation.
- `organizer` journeys:
  - Organizer login and dashboard/event detail visibility.
  - Published event edit restrictions UI (only limited fields editable).
  - Boundary check: decreasing published `Reg Limit` is rejected (`registration limit can only increase`).
  - Draft creation boundary: invalid date ordering rejected (`endDate must be after startDate`).
  - MERCH draft creation with valid payload succeeds.
- `admin` journeys:
  - Admin login + organizer management.
  - Create organizer returns generated credentials.
  - Newly created organizer can log in immediately.
  - Disable organizer blocks login (`Organizer account is disabled`).

**Discovered Issues**
- No deterministic product defect found in the explored role flows.
- Environment limitation: local Playwright CLI browser launch fails in this sandbox (`sandbox_host_linux.cc`), so I validated via MCP browser and added a regression test file without local CLI execution.

**Changes Made**
- Added one new meaningful edge-case Playwright test (regular suite, non-smoke):
  - `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-published-reg-limit-decrease.spec.js`

**Checks Run**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` ✅
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` ✅
- `npm --prefix automation/playwright test -- --project=chromium-desktop organizer-published-reg-limit-decrease.spec.js` ❌ (sandbox browser-launch restriction, not app failure)

**Edited Files**
- `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-published-reg-limit-decrease.spec.js`

**Remaining Risks**
- Full local Playwright execution is blocked by sandbox browser-launch constraints in this session.
- DB runtime state was exercised (new organizer/event created/disabled) during exploratory testing; overnight reset scripts should normalize this, but current live state is not pristine until reset.

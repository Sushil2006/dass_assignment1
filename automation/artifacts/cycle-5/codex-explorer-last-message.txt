**Validated Flows (MCP Browser)**
- `admin`:
  - Login redirect to `/admin`.
  - RBAC guard: direct `/participant` navigation redirected back to `/admin`.
  - `/admin/organizers`: create organizer credentials flow worked.
  - `/admin/password-reset-requests`: route accessible and rendered.
- `organizer`:
  - Login to `/organizer`.
  - Dashboard event cards/actions visible.
  - Published-event edit boundary: decreasing `regLimit` returned expected validation error (`Published event registration limit can only increase`).
- `participant`:
  - Login redirect to `/participant`.
  - RBAC guard: direct `/admin` navigation redirected back to `/participant`.
  - Browse filters: invalid date range (`from > to`) surfaced deterministic API validation error.
  - Event registration (NORMAL) succeeded; ticket generated and ticket page rendered.
  - Duplicate active participation correctly blocked with “already have an active participation”.
  - Cancel participation moved record to Cancelled/Rejected tab.
  - Organizer unfollow reflected in browse filter (`followed clubs only` returned no events).

**Discovered Issues**
- No functional product defect was found in the exercised scope.
- Environment issue: local Playwright CLI (`npm --prefix automation/playwright test`) cannot launch Chromium in this sandbox (`sandbox_host_linux.cc ... Operation not permitted`). MCP browser testing still worked.

**Changes Made**
- Added one new meaningful edge-case test (as requested when no defect is found):
  - `automation/playwright/tests/participant-cancel-reregister.spec.js`
  - Covers: participant registers, cancels, then re-registers for the same event (using a fresh organizer-created published event for determinism).

**Local Checks**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` ✅
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` ✅

**Edited Files**
- `automation/playwright/tests/participant-cancel-reregister.spec.js`

**Remaining Risks**
- Could not execute the repository Playwright suite in this sandbox due browser-launch restriction, so the new spec wasn’t run via CLI here.
- Advanced organizer password-reset workflow appears stubbed in UI (`/admin/password-reset-requests`), which may be fine if not selected for Tier B, but remains a scope/compliance risk if expected.

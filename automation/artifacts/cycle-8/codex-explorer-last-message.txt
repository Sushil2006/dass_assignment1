**Validated Flows (MCP Browser)**
- Participant:
  - Login/logout, RBAC redirect (`/admin` redirected to `/participant`).
  - Browse events search/filter negative case (`zzzznotfoundcase` -> “No events match current filters”).
  - Event registration (normal event), ticket generation, cancel participation, re-register path.
  - Profile onboarding save (including empty-followed-organizers case), change-password mismatch validation.
  - New IIIT signup (`@iiit.ac.in`) correctly classified as `participantType=iiit` on profile.
- Organizer:
  - Login, dashboard/nav, create draft event, publish event.
  - Invalid event date boundary rejected (`endDate must be after startDate`).
  - Published-edit modal behavior checked.
- Admin:
  - Login, manage organizers page.
  - Blank organizer name validation.
  - Organizer provisioning (generated credentials), immediate organizer login.
  - Disable organizer and verify disabled organizer login is blocked (`Organizer account is disabled`).

**Discovered Issues**
- No reproducible product defect found in the exercised flows.
- Per your constraint for “no bug found”, I added one meaningful edge Playwright test.

**What I Changed**
- Added test: `automation/playwright/tests/participant-iiit-signup-profile.spec.js:1`
  - Covers IIIT-domain signup classification and onboarding completion persistence.

**Checks After Change**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` passed.
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` passed.
- Attempted to run the new local Playwright test, but this sandbox cannot launch Chromium (`sandbox_host_linux.cc` “Operation not permitted”). MCP browser validation still worked.

**Edited Files**
- `automation/playwright/tests/participant-iiit-signup-profile.spec.js`

**Remaining Risks**
- Local Playwright CLI execution is blocked by sandbox browser-launch restrictions, so the new test is not locally executed here.
- Manual exploratory actions changed runtime DB state (created users/events, disabled organizer), which can affect subsequent non-reset runs.
- Repository already had substantial unrelated dirty/untracked changes before this pass; I left them untouched.

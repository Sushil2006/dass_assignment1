**Tested Flows**
- `RBAC/route guards`: unauthenticated user redirected to `/login`; participant blocked from `/admin` and `/organizer`; organizer blocked from `/admin` and `/participant`; admin blocked from `/organizer` and `/participant`.
- `Participant`: browse events, invalid date-range boundary (`from > to`), open event detail, normal registration required-field behavior, successful registration, ticket open/QR visible, duplicate signup email rejection, organizers search no-results, follow/unfollow toggle.
- `Organizer`: login, My Events, published-event edit boundary (reg-limit decrease blocked), create-event invalid date ordering boundary, valid draft creation.
- `Admin`: organizer management page, invalid organizer-name boundary, valid organizer creation (credentials shown), organizer disable action, disabled organizer login blocked.
- `Admin password-reset page`: route/nav reachable and page renders.

**Discovered Issue + Fix**
- Defect: boundary validation failures were surfaced as generic messages like `Invalid request` / `Invalid query` in key UI flows, hiding actionable reason.
- Fix: added shared API error parser to extract first field/form detail when backend sends `error.details`, and wired affected pages to use it.
- Result verified in browser:
  - Admin invalid organizer name now shows `Too small: expected string to have >=1 characters`.
  - Organizer invalid deadline now shows `regDeadline must be before or equal to startDate`.
  - Participant invalid date range now shows `to must be greater than or equal to from`.

**Fast Checks (after each code fix)**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` passed.
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` passed.

**Edited Files**
- `frontend/src/lib/errors.ts:1`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/ManageOrganizers.tsx:16`
- `frontend/src/pages/organizer/CreateEventWizard.tsx:5`
- `frontend/src/pages/participant/BrowseEvents.tsx:15`

**Remaining Risks**
- The new detailed error parsing is wired only in the three touched pages; other pages still use local parsers and may still show generic validation messages.
- Exploratory pass mutated seeded runtime data (created/disabled organizer, created draft event, created participation/ticket); future runs should reset DB state if strict determinism is needed.
- I did not run the full repository Playwright suite in this pass; this was MCP-driven exploratory coverage plus required build/typecheck checks.

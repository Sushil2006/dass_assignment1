**Tested/Validated**
- Parsed `docs/assignment1.pdf` and aligned against organizer nav requirement (Section 10.1 includes `Profile` in organizer navbar).
- Attempted Playwright MCP browser launch against `http://127.0.0.1:4173/login`; blocked because Chrome is missing (`/opt/google/chrome/chrome` not found), so MCP browser actions were skipped per your rule.
- Attempted repository Playwright execution; browser launch is sandbox-blocked here (`sandbox_host_linux.cc ... Operation not permitted`), so live browser flows could not run in this environment.
- Added deterministic smoke coverage for:
  - Organizer profile navbar path.
  - RBAC redirect when participant tries organizer profile route.

**Defect Found + Fix**
- Defect: Organizer navbar `Profile` pointed to `/organizer` (dashboard), not a profile route, so the profile journey was broken from core nav.
- Fix:
  - Updated organizer nav profile link to `/organizer/profile` in `frontend/src/components/AppNav.tsx:24`.
  - Added protected route for organizer profile in `frontend/src/App.tsx:44`.

**New Playwright Coverage**
- Added `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-profile-nav.smoke.spec.js:1`:
  - Organizer login -> navbar `Profile` -> asserts `/organizer/profile` + profile UI.
  - Participant login -> direct `/organizer/profile` -> asserts redirect to `/participant`.

**Checks Run**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` ✅
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` ✅
- `npm --prefix automation/playwright run test -- --list` ✅ (new smoke test discovered)
- `npm --prefix automation/playwright run test -- tests/organizer-profile-nav.smoke.spec.js --project=chromium-desktop` ❌ blocked by sandbox browser launch permissions, not app logic.

**Edited Files**
- `frontend/src/components/AppNav.tsx`
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-profile-nav.smoke.spec.js`

**Remaining Risks**
- Full exploratory browser QA (admin/organizer/participant live journeys, negative/boundary UI interactions) remains partially unexecuted in this session due environment limits: missing MCP Chrome and sandboxed Playwright launch restrictions.
- This workspace now has untracked runtime artifacts from attempted Playwright/automation runs (`automation/artifacts/...`, `automation/playwright/test-results/...`, `automation/reports/...`); `rm` is blocked by sandbox policy here, so cleanup could not be completed from this session.

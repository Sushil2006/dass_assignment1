**Validated Flows**
- Checked spec context from `docs/assignment1.pdf` and aligned QA to RBAC/navigation/event participation paths.
- MCP browser: unauthenticated route guards redirect correctly:
  - `/admin` -> `/login`
  - `/organizer` -> `/login`
  - `/participant` -> `/login`
- MCP browser: negative login case works (`Invalid credentials`).
- MCP browser (before backend became unavailable): participant login, dashboard/nav visibility, browse events, event detail open, successful registration, ticket link generation, duplicate-active-participation block.
- MCP browser (after backend outage): confirmed login page remained usable under repeated `/api/auth/me` network failures without runtime `TypeError` logs after fix.

**Discovered Issue + Fix**
- Defect: auth bootstrap failures were not safely handled in frontend auth boot paths, causing runtime promise/type errors when `/api/auth/me` failed (seen in console earlier as `TypeError: Failed to fetch`).
- Fix:
  - `frontend/src/lib/authState.ts:8` catches `getMe()` failures and safely sets user to logged-out state.
  - `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx:23` wraps initial `getMe()` boot call in `try/catch` and uses `void boot()` to avoid unhandled promise behavior.
- Added regression coverage:
  - `automation/playwright/tests/auth-bootstrap-resilience.smoke.spec.js:1`
  - This smoke test forces `/api/auth/me` failure and asserts login page stability with no runtime promise/type errors.

**Required Local Checks**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` passed.
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` passed.
- Attempted Playwright CLI run for new test, but local browser launch is blocked by sandbox (`sandbox_host_linux.cc` fatal). MCP browser QA was used instead.

**Edited Files**
- `frontend/src/lib/authState.ts`
- `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`
- `automation/playwright/tests/auth-bootstrap-resilience.smoke.spec.js`

**Remaining Risks**
- Backend at `127.0.0.1:4100` became unreachable during the session (connection refused), so full live admin/organizer end-to-end journeys could not be completed in this run.
- Local Playwright CLI execution is blocked in this sandbox, so the new smoke test could not be executed here even though it is added and ready for CI/normal local environments.

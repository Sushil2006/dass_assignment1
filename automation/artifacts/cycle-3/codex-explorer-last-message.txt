**Tested Flows + Findings**

- Used Playwright MCP browser for end-to-end role journeys against the assignment spec in `docs/assignment1.pdf` (core Part 1 flows).
- Participant:
  - Signup boundary: password length `< 8` blocked.
  - Successful signup + dashboard redirect.
  - RBAC negatives: participant blocked from `/admin` and `/organizer`.
  - Browse/search/filter negative (`no match`) and reset behavior.
  - Event registration with required-field boundary and ticket generation.
  - My Events tab transitions (upcoming → cancelled/rejected) via cancel action.
  - Profile constraints: read-only fields, onboarding save, password mismatch + wrong-current-password errors.
  - Organizer follow/unfollow flow from clubs page.
- Organizer:
  - Dashboard/nav and event lifecycle actions.
  - Published-event edit restrictions enforced (only allowed fields editable).
  - Boundary validation on registration limit (`0`) blocked.
  - Close event transition to `CLOSED`.
- Admin:
  - Manage organizers: create organizer + generated credentials.
  - Disable organizer and verify disabled organizer login is rejected.
  - Delete guard for organizer with existing events enforced.
  - Delete disabled organizer without events works.
  - Password Reset Requests route reachable.
- **Defects found in product code:** none reproducible in this pass.
- Environment issue observed: direct local Playwright CLI launch in this sandbox fails at Chromium startup (`sandbox_host_linux.cc ... Operation not permitted`), while MCP browser flows worked.

**What I Changed**

- Added one deterministic edge-case Playwright test (as requested when no defect is found):
  - `automation/playwright/tests/participant-closed-event-registration-block.spec.js`
  - Covers: organizer closes seeded event, participant sees registration blocked in browse + detail views.

**Fast Local Checks**

- `npm --prefix frontend run build` ✅ pass
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` ✅ pass

**Edited Files**

- `automation/playwright/tests/participant-closed-event-registration-block.spec.js`

**Remaining Risks**

- New Playwright test could not be executed via local Playwright CLI in this sandbox due browser launch restriction; it should be run in the normal automation runner environment.
- Workspace contains unrelated pre-existing modified/untracked files from ongoing automation cycles; I did not alter those.

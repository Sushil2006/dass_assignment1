**Failure Root Cause**
Cycle-3 failed because frontend silently shifted from `4173` to `4176` (`automation/artifacts/cycle-3/frontend.log:5`, `automation/artifacts/cycle-3/frontend.log:11`), while Playwright/login helper still waited for `/api/auth/login` on the expected app path and timed out (`automation/artifacts/cycle-3/playwright/stdout.log:8`, `automation/artifacts/cycle-3/playwright/stdout.log:17`). Backend was otherwise up (`automation/artifacts/cycle-3/backend.log:5`).

**Files Changed**
- `automation/scripts/start_services.sh:17`
- `automation/scripts/start_services.sh:47`
- `automation/scripts/start_services.sh:55`
- `automation/scripts/start_services.sh:71`
- `automation/playwright/playwright.config.js:3`
- `automation/playwright/playwright.config.js:4`

What I changed:
- Kept frontend startup strict on configured port (`--strictPort`) and startup PID checks in `start_services.sh` so port drift fails fast instead of causing hidden test flake.
- Forced backend `CLIENT_ORIGIN` to match `FRONTEND_PORT` in `start_services.sh` to prevent CORS origin mismatch.
- Made Playwright config derive fallback base URL from `FRONTEND_PORT` (not hardcoded `4173`) in `playwright.config.js`.

**Validation Commands Run**
1. `npm --prefix frontend run build`  
   - Passed.
2. `npm --prefix backend run typecheck`  
   - Passed.
3. `bash automation/scripts/run_playwright_suite.sh`  
   - Failed in this sandbox due Playwright/Chromium launch restriction, not app logic: `FATAL:content/browser/sandbox_host_linux.cc ... Operation not permitted` (see `automation/artifacts/manual/playwright/stdout.log`).
4. Additional reproduction attempt: `bash automation/scripts/start_services.sh ...`  
   - Blocked by sandbox socket restrictions (`listen EPERM` on local ports/tsx IPC), so full local E2E repro is environment-limited here.

**Root Cause (from cycle artifacts)**
Cycle-3 failed because the frontend process did not stay on the expected port. In `automation/artifacts/cycle-3/frontend.log`, Vite reported `4173` in use and switched to `4176`, while Playwright still targeted `http://127.0.0.1:4173`. The failing snapshots show login alert `Failed to fetch`, and tests timed out waiting for `/api/auth/login` responses.  
So the suite was hitting the wrong/stale frontend/backend combination (non-deterministic startup), not a product-login logic regression.

**Fix Implemented**
Updated startup orchestration to make service boot deterministic and fail fast:
- Enforce strict frontend port binding (`--strictPort`) so it cannot silently drift.
- Verify backend/frontend startup PIDs are still alive before/after health checks.
- Add failure trap to stop started services automatically if startup fails.

Changed file:
- `automation/scripts/start_services.sh:18`
- `automation/scripts/start_services.sh:66`
- `automation/scripts/start_services.sh:71`
- `automation/scripts/start_services.sh:83`

**Validation Run**
1. `npm --prefix frontend run build`  
   - Passed.
2. `npm --prefix backend run typecheck`  
   - Passed.
3. `bash automation/scripts/run_playwright_suite.sh automation/.env.overnight automation/artifacts/manual-suite-after-fix`  
   - Failed in this sandbox due Chromium launch restriction: `sandbox_host_linux.cc:41 ... Operation not permitted` (environmental, not app/test assertion failure).  
   - Log: `automation/artifacts/manual-suite-after-fix/playwright/stdout.log`

If you want, I can also add a preflight check in `run_playwright_suite.sh` to assert backend/frontend health before running tests, so failures are immediate and explicit when services are not reachable.

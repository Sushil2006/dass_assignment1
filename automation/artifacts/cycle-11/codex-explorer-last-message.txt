**Validated Flows (MCP browser)**
- Admin:
  - Login, navbar RBAC links, `Password Reset Requests` page load, organizer management page load.
- Organizer:
  - Login, navbar links, create-event boundary (`endDate < startDate`) correctly blocked with error.
  - Profile edit boundary: invalid `contactEmail` blocked by form validation.
- Participant:
  - Login, browse events, filters/search, invalid date-range boundary (`to < from`) returns error and clears stale lists.
  - Event registration success path (ticket generated and link shown).
  - Cancel participation from `My Events`, then re-register path works.
  - Change-password negative case (wrong current password) correctly rejected.
- RBAC negatives:
  - Participant direct access to `/admin/password-reset-requests` redirected to `/participant`.
  - Participant direct access to `/organizer/profile` redirected to `/participant`.

**Discovered Issues**
- No clear product defect found in the exercised spec-critical flows.
- Existing suite failures I inspected looked mainly selector/test-fragility related, not confirmed app behavior defects from MCP runs.

**What I Changed**
- Added one meaningful edge-case Playwright test (as requested when no defect is found):
  - `automation/playwright/tests/participant-profile-immutable-fields.spec.js`
  - Verifies participant profile read-only constraints from spec:
    - UI fields are disabled (`Email`, `Participant Type`)
    - Backend profile patch cannot mutate immutable fields (`email`, `participantType`)
    - Values remain unchanged after attempted mutation.

**Required Local Checks**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` ✅
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` ✅

**Additional Test Execution**
- Focused run of the new Playwright test via CLI could not execute in this sandbox due browser launch restriction (`sandbox_host_linux.cc` fatal).  
  MCP browser-based validation was used successfully for functional checks.

**Edited Files**
- `automation/playwright/tests/participant-profile-immutable-fields.spec.js`

**Remaining Risks**
- Could not run local Playwright CLI in this sandbox, so the new test is not CLI-verified here.
- Not exhaustively validated in this pass: merch stock exhaustion flow, QR/ticket scan flow, CSV export correctness, email delivery contents.
- Repo is concurrently used by overnight automation, so test-data state can drift between runs.

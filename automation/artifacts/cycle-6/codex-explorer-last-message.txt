**Validated Flows (Playwright MCP)**
- `participant`: login/logout, dashboard nav, browse search/no-result filtering, organizer detail, event registration success (ticket generated), my-events visibility, profile password-change negative paths (mismatch/current-password-wrong), RBAC redirect from `/admin/*`.
- `organizer`: login/logout, dashboard/nav (`/organizer`, `/organizer/ongoing`, `/organizer/profile`), create-event boundary (`regDeadline > startDate` correctly blocked with server error).
- `admin`: login/logout, organizer management list/create/disable/delete, password-reset-requests page routing, RBAC checks.
- Negative/boundary interactions executed: invalid login, whitespace organizer name, invalid event date ordering, password mismatch, wrong current password, participant forbidden from admin route.

**Discovered Defect + Fix**
1. Defect: Admin creating organizer with whitespace-only name showed poor/raw validation behavior.
- Repro: Admin → Manage Organizers → name=`"   "` → Create.
- Before: backend-origin schema text surfaced.
- Fix: client-side trimmed-name guard with explicit message and early return.
- Change: `frontend/src/pages/admin/ManageOrganizers.tsx:83`

**Local Checks After Fix**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` ✅
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` ✅

**Edited Files**
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/ManageOrganizers.tsx`

**Remaining Risks**
- This pass was exploratory/manual (not a full Playwright suite run), so untested combinations still exist (especially deeper merch/payment/advanced-feature branches).
- Workspace has many unrelated pre-existing modified/untracked files; I only changed the file listed above.

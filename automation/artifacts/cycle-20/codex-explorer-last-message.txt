**Tested Flows**
- `admin` journey: login, navigate to organizer management, create organizer, read generated credentials, logout, and organizer first login + draft event creation (`automation/playwright/tests/admin-organizer.spec.js:13`).
- `organizer` negative/boundary: invalid Discord webhook rejected; invalid event timeline (`endDate < startDate`) rejected (`automation/playwright/tests/admin-organizer.spec.js:45`, `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-boundary.spec.js:13`).
- `participant` journey: login, invalid profile input rejected, onboarding save, organizer follow/unfollow, browse events (`automation/playwright/tests/participant-flows.spec.js:4`).
- `RBAC/auth` negatives: unauthenticated redirects, invalid login error, signup, and cross-role route-guard behavior (`automation/playwright/tests/auth-rbac.spec.js:4`).

**Discovered Issues And Fixes**
- Defect: Admin Manage Organizers page crashed due undefined `email/setEmail` references in create form.
- Fix: Removed stale email input (backend auto-generates organizer email), keeping only name field.
- File: `frontend/src/pages/admin/ManageOrganizers.tsx:177`

- Defect: Authenticated users hitting unauthorized role routes were redirected to `/login` instead of their own dashboard.
- Fix: `ProtectedRoute` now redirects unauthorized authenticated users to role home (`/participant`, `/organizer`, `/admin`).
- File: `frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx:7`

- QA harness updates to keep deterministic regression coverage aligned with current UI:
- `automation/playwright/tests/admin-organizer.spec.js:23` (menu label + generated email extraction + no manual email input)
- `automation/playwright/utils/auth.js:31` (logout works for button or link render)
- Added boundary test: `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-boundary.spec.js:1`

**Checks Run**
- After each app fix:
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` passed.
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` passed.
- Regression runs passed:
- `npx playwright test tests/auth-rbac.spec.js tests/admin-organizer.spec.js tests/participant-flows.spec.js tests/organizer-boundary.spec.js --project=chromium-desktop` (7 passed).

**Edited Files**
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/ManageOrganizers.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- `automation/playwright/tests/admin-organizer.spec.js`
- `automation/playwright/utils/auth.js`
- `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-boundary.spec.js`

**Remaining Risks**
- Playwright MCP browser could not be used in this environment because it requires system Chrome at `/opt/google/chrome/chrome` and install requires sudo; validation was done with local Playwright Chromium instead.
- Coverage here is Chromium desktop only; no mobile/cross-browser verification in this pass.
- Repository has unrelated pre-existing dirty/untracked automation artifacts outside these targeted fixes.

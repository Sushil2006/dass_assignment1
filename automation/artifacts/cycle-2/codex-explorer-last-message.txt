**Validated Flows**
- Participant:
  - Login, dashboard/nav access, RBAC redirect from `/admin` to `/participant`.
  - Browse events load, open event detail, submit normal registration, ticket generation, ticket detail open.
  - Negative: invalid ticket ID shows `Ticket not found`.
  - Organizer follow/unfollow and `followed clubs only` filter boundary (empty when unfollowed).
  - Profile password change negatives: wrong current password and confirm mismatch both correctly rejected.
- Organizer:
  - Login and role nav.
  - RBAC redirect from participant route back to organizer dashboard.
  - Profile update negative: invalid Discord webhook URL rejected with `Invalid request`.
- Admin:
  - Login and organizer management page.
  - Create organizer account, disable organizer account.
  - Negative: disabled organizer login blocked with `Organizer account is disabled`.

**Discovered Issue + Fix**
- Issue: Browser QA showed password-form DOM warnings on participant profile change-password form (missing autocomplete/username context).
- Fix applied:
  - Added `autocomplete` attributes (`current-password`, `new-password`) and hidden `username` context field in `ChangePassword`.
  - Passed participant email into `ChangePassword`.
- Files:
  - `frontend/src/pages/common/ChangePassword.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/pages/participant/Profile.tsx`

**Post-fix Checks**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` ✅
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` ✅

**Edited Files**
- `frontend/src/pages/common/ChangePassword.tsx:14`
- `frontend/src/pages/participant/Profile.tsx:320`

**Remaining Risks**
- Full local Playwright CLI suite could not be executed in this sandbox due Chromium launch failure (`sandbox_host_linux.cc ... Operation not permitted`), so only MCP-browser exploratory coverage was run.
- High-variance paths not deeply exercised in this pass: merch stock depletion edge cases, file-upload field registration, and full admin delete/archive lifecycle permutations.
- Repo has pre-existing unrelated dirty changes/artifacts outside this fix; I did not modify those intentionally.

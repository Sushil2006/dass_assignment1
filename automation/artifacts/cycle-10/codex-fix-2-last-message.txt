**Root Cause**
Cycle-10 failures were primarily flaky/incorrect Playwright selectors in organizer/participant event-card tests:

1. `organizer-published-edit-limited` and `organizer-published-reg-limit-decrease` used `getByRole('button', { name: 'Edit' }).first()`, which is order-dependent and can open the wrong event editor.
2. `participant-closed-event-registration-block` used `.card` + broad text filtering, which matched wrapper carousel cards instead of the actual event card.

These tests were asserting behavior on unintended elements, so they failed nondeterministically even when app behavior was valid.

**Files Changed**
1. `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-published-edit-limited.spec.js`  
   - Targeted a deterministic published event card (`.card.h-100.border` + event name + `Edit`) before opening the editor.
2. `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-published-reg-limit-decrease.spec.js`  
   - Same deterministic card targeting as above; removed remaining generic `Edit().first()` reopen step.
3. `automation/playwright/tests/participant-closed-event-registration-block.spec.js`  
   - Narrowed organizer/participant card locators to real event cards (`.card.h-100.border`) with role-based action filters (`Open` / `View details`), avoiding wrapper-card matches.

**Validation Commands Run**
1. `npm --prefix frontend run build`  
   - Passed.
2. `npm --prefix backend run typecheck`  
   - Passed.
3. `bash automation/scripts/run_playwright_suite.sh`  
   - Failed before test execution due environment/browser launch issue:  
   `FATAL:content/browser/sandbox_host_linux.cc:41 ... Operation not permitted`.
4. Iteration attempt:  
   `PW_HEADLESS=false bash automation/scripts/run_playwright_suite.sh automation/.env.overnight automation/artifacts/manual-headful-attempt`  
   - Still failed with the same Chromium launch/sandbox error (env file resets headless settings; browser still crashes before tests run).

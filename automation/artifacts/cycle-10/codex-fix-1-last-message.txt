**Root Cause**
- The cycle-10 failures were primarily test issues:
- `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-status-transition-boundary.spec.js:18` and `automation/playwright/tests/participant-cancel-reregister.spec.js:13` used relative `/api/...` URLs via Playwright request APIs, but `frontend/vite.config.ts` has no `/api` proxy. Those requests were hitting frontend origin instead of backend.
- `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-boundary.spec.js:36` asserted a generic `"Invalid request"` toast, while UI now surfaces the specific validation message (`endDate must be after startDate`).
- `automation/playwright/tests/participant-browse-invalid-date-range.spec.js:16` used `getByLabel('To')`, which is ambiguous with navbar `"Toggle navigation"` in strict mode.
- The stale-results app bug for invalid browse filters is already addressed in current workspace at `frontend/src/pages/participant/BrowseEvents.tsx:91` (`setEvents([])` on load failure).

**Files Changed**
- `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-status-transition-boundary.spec.js`
- `automation/playwright/tests/participant-cancel-reregister.spec.js`
- `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-boundary.spec.js`
- `automation/playwright/tests/participant-browse-invalid-date-range.spec.js`

**Validation Commands Run**
1. `npm --prefix frontend run build`  
   - Passed.
2. `npm --prefix backend run typecheck`  
   - Passed.
3. `bash automation/scripts/run_playwright_suite.sh automation/.env.overnight automation/artifacts/manual-fix-cycle10-final`  
   - Failed before test execution due environment/browser sandbox issue:
   - `FATAL:content/browser/sandbox_host_linux.cc:41 ... Operation not permitted`
   - Same launch failure reproduced in `automation/artifacts/manual-repro-cycle10/playwright/stdout.log`.

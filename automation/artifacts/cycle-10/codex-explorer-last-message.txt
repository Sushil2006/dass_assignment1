**Validated Flows (Playwright MCP)**
- Auth/RBAC: invalid login error, unauthenticated redirect to `/login`, role-guard redirects (`admin` blocked from participant pages and vice versa).
- Admin journey: login, organizer creation, generated credentials display, organizer disable action, disabled organizer login blocked.
- Organizer journey: dashboard navigation, published-event edit modal constraints, reg-limit decrease rejected, reg-limit increase accepted.
- Participant journey: browse filters, invalid date-range error path, event detail registration, ticket open, duplicate-active-registration blocked, cancel + re-register flow, profile password mismatch validation.

**Defect Found and Fixed**
- Defect: On browse search failure (example: invalid date range), stale “All Events” cards stayed visible while error was shown.
- Fix: Clear event list on load failure in `frontend/src/pages/participant/BrowseEvents.tsx:91`.

**Regression Test Added**
- Added `automation/playwright/tests/participant-browse-invalid-date-range.spec.js:1` to assert:
  - invalid range shows backend validation message
  - stale event card is not shown
  - “No events match current filters.” appears

**Local Checks (after fix)**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` passed.
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` passed.

**Edited Files**
- `frontend/src/pages/participant/BrowseEvents.tsx`
- `automation/playwright/tests/participant-browse-invalid-date-range.spec.js`

**Remaining Risks**
- Repository Playwright CLI runs in this sandbox fail at browser launch (`sandbox_host_linux.cc ... Operation not permitted`), so the new spec file could not be executed here via CLI.
- `AdminPasswordResetRequests` appears static (`frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminPasswordResetRequests.tsx`) with no implemented organizer reset-request workflow, which is a spec-risk area.

**Validated Flows (Playwright MCP)**
- Participant:
  - Login/logout and session redirect behavior.
  - RBAC guard by forcing `/admin` and `/organizer` while logged in as participant (redirected back to participant area).
  - Browse Events filters including invalid date range (`from > to`), normal event detail, registration success, ticket generation, My Events cancel flow, and profile constraints (read-only fields + password mismatch validation).
- Organizer:
  - Dashboard, event detail/participants view, ongoing-events view, profile edit screen (login email read-only), and create-event invalid date boundary.
- Admin:
  - Dashboard, Manage Clubs/Organizers page, Password Reset Requests page, and empty create-organizer submit boundary.

**Discovered Issues**
1. Fixed: Participant Browse Events allowed invalid date-range submit to hit backend (`/api/events?from=...&to=...` with `from > to`), causing 400 and clearing visible lists.
2. Observed (not fixed in this pass): Organizer create-event with invalid date ordering still reaches backend and returns 400 instead of being fully blocked client-side.

**What I Changed**
- Added client-side guard to block invalid participant browse date range before fetch:
  - `frontend/src/pages/participant/BrowseEvents.tsx:120`
- Updated edge-case Playwright test to assert no invalid-range request is sent and prior results remain visible:
  - `automation/playwright/tests/participant-browse-invalid-date-range.spec.js:4`

**Local Checks After Fix**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` passed.
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` passed.

**Edited Files**
- `frontend/src/pages/participant/BrowseEvents.tsx`
- `automation/playwright/tests/participant-browse-invalid-date-range.spec.js`

**Remaining Risks**
- Organizer create-event invalid date inputs still rely on backend rejection (client pre-validation gap).
- I did not run the full Playwright suite in this pass (only exploratory MCP validation + required build/typecheck).

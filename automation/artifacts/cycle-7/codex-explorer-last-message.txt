Validated flows (Playwright MCP browser):
- `participant`:
  - Invalid login shows `Invalid credentials`.
  - Valid login redirects to `/participant`.
  - RBAC/nav present: Dashboard, Browse Events, Clubs/Organizers, My Events, Profile, Logout.
  - Profile read-only fields enforced (email/type/id), password mismatch validation works.
  - Browse filters: invalid date range returns `to must be greater than or equal to from`.
  - Event registration success generates ticket; duplicate registration is blocked with active-participation alert + ticket link.
  - Organizer follow/unfollow from organizer detail works; `followed clubs only` filter returns no events when none are followed.
- `organizer`:
  - Valid login redirect to `/organizer`; participant route access redirects back to organizer dashboard.
  - Published event edit constraints enforced (only allowed fields; deadline cannot be reduced).
  - Draft event boundary enforced (`endDate must be after startDate`).
  - Profile shows login email as read-only.
- `admin`:
  - Manage organizers page works.
  - Empty organizer create blocked (`Organizer name is required`).
  - Disable organizer works; disabled organizer login blocked (`Organizer account is disabled`).
  - Delete organizer with linked events blocked (`Archive/disable instead of delete`).
  - Create organizer returns credentials and new organizer can immediately log in.

Discovered issues:
- No new functional product defect was found in this pass.
- Environment issue: local Playwright CLI browser launch fails in this sandbox (`sandbox_host_linux.cc` / `Operation not permitted`), so MCP browser was used for execution.

What I changed:
- Added one deterministic edge-case test (as requested when no bug found):
  - `automation/playwright/tests/participant-followed-clubs-empty-filter.spec.js`

Local checks run:
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` ✅
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` ✅
- `npm --prefix automation/playwright run test -- tests/participant-followed-clubs-empty-filter.spec.js --project=chromium-desktop` ❌ (sandbox browser launch restriction, not app failure)

Edited files:
- `automation/playwright/tests/participant-followed-clubs-empty-filter.spec.js`

Remaining risks:
- I changed runtime data while validating admin/organizer flows (disabled seeded organizer `organizer+overnight@example.com` and created `qa-temp-club-a561@felicity.local`); there is no “re-enable organizer” route/UI in current code.
- Password reset requests flow appears UI-only in current implementation (admin page shows empty state; no obvious organizer request entry path/API surfaced in code scan).
- New test could not be executed via local Playwright CLI in this sandbox due browser-launch restrictions; functional behavior was validated through MCP browser instead.

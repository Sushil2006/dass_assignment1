**Validated Flows**
- Participant:
  - Invalid login shows `Invalid credentials`.
  - Valid login lands on `/participant`.
  - Browse Events filters/search: no-match case returns `No events match current filters.`
  - Event registration flow: successful registration generates ticket link; ticket detail page renders QR + payload.
  - Cancel participation moves record to `Cancelled/Rejected` tab.
  - Direct access to draft/invalid event IDs shows proper error states (`Event not found` / `Invalid event id`).
  - RBAC check: participant hitting admin route is redirected back to participant dashboard.
  - Onboarding skip path works: `Save Onboarding` succeeds with zero followed organizers.

- Organizer:
  - Valid login lands on `/organizer`.
  - Create Event boundary: invalid date ordering is rejected (`Invalid request`).
  - Organizer event detail: participants tab filters render correctly; CSV export downloads successfully.
  - Profile boundary: invalid contact email is blocked by form validation.

- Admin:
  - Valid login lands on `/admin`.
  - Organizer creation generates credentials.
  - Disable organizer blocks subsequent organizer login (`Organizer account is disabled`).
  - Delete guard for organizer with linked events returns expected error and blocks deletion.
  - Password reset requests page route and empty state render correctly.

**Discovered Issues**
- No functional defect found in this pass.

**Changes Made**
- Added one meaningful edge-case Playwright test:
  - `automation/playwright/tests/admin-organizer-delete-guard.spec.js:1`
  - Covers: admin cannot delete organizer when linked events exist (expects `409`, error message, and row still present).

**Local Checks Run**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` ✅
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` ✅

**Edited Files**
- `automation/playwright/tests/admin-organizer-delete-guard.spec.js`

**Remaining Risks**
- I could not run shell-driven local service reset/start in this sandbox due local TCP restrictions (`EPERM`), so validation depended on already-running app endpoints.
- Full Playwright suite was not executed in this pass; coverage here is targeted exploratory + one new regression test.
- Advanced optional features (Tier A/B/C extras) were not deeply exercised unless surfaced in core routes.

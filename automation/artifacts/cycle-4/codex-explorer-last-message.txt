**Validated Flows (Playwright MCP, spec-aligned)**
- `participant`: login success/failure, RBAC redirects from `/admin` and `/organizer`, browse/search/filter, event detail, normal-event registration, ticket generation + ticket detail (QR payload), My Events tab transitions, cancel flow, profile read-only constraints and password mismatch rejection.
- `organizer`: login, RBAC redirect from `/admin/*`, dashboard + event detail participants/filtering, published-event edit boundary checks (limit decrease blocked, deadline shortening blocked), profile form validation behavior.
- `admin`: login, RBAC redirect from `/participant`, organizer management table/actions, disable organizer action, password-reset-requests page navigation.

**Discovered Issues**
- No clear app code defect found in the exercised journeys.
- Added a new deterministic edge-case test for a validated boundary: disabled organizer cannot log in.

**Changed Files**
- `automation/playwright/tests/admin-organizer-disable-login-block.spec.js`

**Local Checks**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` ✅
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` ✅
- `npm --prefix automation/playwright test tests/admin-organizer-disable-login-block.spec.js` ❌ blocked by sandboxed browser launch (`sandbox_host_linux.cc` EPERM), so CLI Playwright execution is not usable in this environment.

**Remaining Risks**
- Shell-level network/db access is sandbox-blocked here (could not run direct DB restore operations).
- During manual validation, the seeded organizer account was disabled via admin UI and this environment has no admin “re-enable” path; state should be reset before broader shared runs.
- Full Playwright suite execution from CLI remains unverified in this sandbox due Chromium launch restrictions.

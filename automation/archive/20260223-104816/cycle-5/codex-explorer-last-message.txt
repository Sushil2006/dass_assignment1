**Validated Flows**
- Used `docs/assignment1.pdf` as spec source (the provided `../docs/assignment1.pdf` path was absent).
- Participant:
  - Login, dashboard redirect, logout.
  - Browse filters/search reset and no-match behavior.
  - Event registration boundary: required-field block, successful registration, ticket link generation.
  - Invalid ticket route shows not-found state.
  - My Events cancel flow updates tab counts/status.
  - Profile boundary: password mismatch validation.
  - RBAC: participant hitting `/admin` redirected to `/participant`.
- Organizer:
  - Login/dashboard/nav.
  - Create event boundary: invalid date ordering rejected; valid draft creation accepted.
  - Event detail CSV export works.
  - RBAC: organizer hitting `/participant` redirected to `/organizer`.
- Admin:
  - Login/dashboard/nav.
  - Organizer creation boundary: empty/whitespace name rejected.
  - Organizer creation success with generated credentials.
  - Disable organizer works; disabled organizer login blocked.
  - Password Reset Requests page route reachable.
- Negative auth:
  - Invalid login shows `Invalid credentials`.
  - Valid admin login/logout still works after fixes.

**Defect Found + Fixed**
- Defect: duplicated auth bootstrap checks caused repeated `/api/auth/me` calls and noisy auth failures on unauthenticated paths.
- Root cause: auth state was not shared globally; multiple components were independently fetching auth (`useAuth` local state + navbar route sync + login bootstrap).
- Fix:
  - Added shared auth provider/context in `frontend/src/lib/authState.ts`.
  - Wrapped app with provider in `frontend/src/App.tsx`.
  - Removed route-change auth polling from `frontend/src/components/AppNav.tsx`.
  - Updated login/signup to set shared auth state directly in `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx` and `frontend/src/pages/Signup.tsx`.
- Post-fix MCP check: bootstrap auth traffic dropped (observed from many repeated calls earlier to only strict-mode double calls), and login/logout/RBAC behavior remained correct.

**Fast Checks Run After Fix**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` passed.
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` passed.

**Edited Files**
- `frontend/src/lib/authState.ts`
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/AppNav.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/Signup.tsx`

**Remaining Risks**
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminPasswordResetRequests.tsx` is still a static placeholder; full organizer reset-request lifecycle is not implemented.
- Exploratory runs changed seeded state (new draft event, created+disabled organizer, cancelled participant registration).
- Shell-side DB reset/full local Playwright suite execution was blocked by sandbox TCP restrictions (`EPERM`), so browser validation was done via Playwright MCP against the running app instance.

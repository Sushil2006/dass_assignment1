**Validated Flows**
- `participant`:
  - Invalid login shows deterministic error (`Invalid credentials`).
  - Successful login redirects to `/participant`.
  - RBAC redirect works: participant navigation to `/admin` returns to `/participant`.
  - Browse -> Event detail -> registration succeeds and generates ticket ID + QR ticket page.
  - Profile password negatives work: mismatched confirm blocked; wrong current password rejected.
- `organizer`:
  - Successful login redirects to `/organizer`.
  - RBAC redirect works: organizer navigation to `/admin` returns to `/organizer`.
  - Reproduced defect on published-event edit path (details below), then re-validated success after fix.
- `admin`:
  - Successful login redirects to `/admin`.
  - Manage organizers: create -> disable -> disabled organizer login blocked -> delete works.
  - Password reset requests page route renders.
  - RBAC redirect works: admin navigation to `/participant` returns to `/admin`.

**Defect Found + Fixed**
- Defect: Published event edit failed even when changing only allowed fields (description/deadline/limit), because frontend always submitted the full event payload, causing backend rejection.
- Fix:
  - `frontend/src/pages/organizer/MyEvents.tsx:174`  
    - Build patch payload conditionally for `PUBLISHED` events (`description`, `regDeadline`, `regLimit` only, changed fields only).
    - Prevent no-op submits.
    - Hide `Edit` button for non-editable lifecycle states (`ONGOING` display, closed/completed statuses).
    - Pass edit policy into the shared editor.
  - `frontend/src/pages/organizer/EventEditorForm.tsx:55`  
    - Added `editPolicy` (`full` vs `published-limited`).
    - In published-limited mode, show explicit rule banner and disable unsupported fields (name/type/tags/eligibility/fee/start/end/form-builder/merch config controls).
- Regression test added:
  - `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-published-edit-limited.spec.js:1`  
    - Verifies published-edit UI restrictions and asserts PATCH payload contains only allowed key(s) for description update.

**Local Checks**
- Ran after fix:
  - `npm --prefix frontend run build` ✅
  - `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` ✅
- Attempted to run new Playwright test directly via CLI, but browser launch is blocked in this sandbox (`sandbox_host_linux.cc ... Operation not permitted`). MCP browser validation was used instead.

**Edited Files**
- `frontend/src/pages/organizer/MyEvents.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/organizer/EventEditorForm.tsx`
- `automation/playwright/tests/organizer-published-edit-limited.spec.js`

**Remaining Risks**
- Not fully covered in this pass:
  - Merchandise purchase edge cases (stock exhaustion/per-participant limit under concurrency).
  - Organizer ongoing/completed event transitions under real-time clock boundaries.
  - Admin password-reset workflow behavior is route-level validated; full request/approve/reject lifecycle was not exercised here.

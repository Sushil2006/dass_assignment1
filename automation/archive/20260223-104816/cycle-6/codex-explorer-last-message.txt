**Tested Flows (Playwright MCP browser)**
- `Participant` auth and RBAC:
  - Invalid login shows error.
  - Valid login redirects to `/participant`.
  - Direct navigation to `/admin/organizers` redirects back to `/participant`.
- `Participant` browse + registration boundaries:
  - Search/filter reset behavior (`Search`, `followed clubs only`, `Reset`).
  - Empty required registration field blocks submit.
  - Successful registration generates ticket link.
- `Organizer` auth and RBAC:
  - Valid login redirects to `/organizer`.
  - Direct navigation to `/participant/profile` redirects to `/organizer`.
- `Organizer` event creation boundaries:
  - Invalid date ordering returns backend validation error.
  - Valid draft creation succeeds and returns event id.
- `Admin` lifecycle and RBAC:
  - Valid login redirects to `/admin`.
  - Organizer creation returns generated credentials.
  - Disabling organizer blocks organizer login (`Organizer account is disabled`).
  - Direct navigation to `/organizer` redirects to `/admin`.

**Discovered Issue + Fix**
- Issue: after successful participant registration, UI showed both:
  - success alert (`Registration submitted...`) and
  - `You already have an active participation...`
  at the same time on the same submit cycle (contradictory feedback).
- Fix: suppress “existing active participation” alert while a success state is present.
  - Updated `frontend/src/pages/participant/EventDetail.tsx:117`
  - Updated conditional render at `frontend/src/pages/participant/EventDetail.tsx:297`

**Added Regression Test**
- Added `automation/playwright/tests/participant-registration-feedback.spec.js:1`
  - Covers: fresh participant signup -> register published event -> assert success/ticket alerts visible and “already active participation” alert absent.

**Local Checks Run**
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` ✅
- `npm --prefix backend run typecheck` ✅
- Attempted: `npm --prefix automation/playwright test tests/participant-registration-feedback.spec.js --project=chromium-desktop` ❌  
  - Blocked by sandboxed Playwright browser launch (`sandbox_host_linux.cc:41 ... Operation not permitted`), so I validated the fix via MCP browser flow instead.

**Edited Files**
- `frontend/src/pages/participant/EventDetail.tsx`
- `automation/playwright/tests/participant-registration-feedback.spec.js`

**Remaining Risks**
- CLI Playwright execution in this environment is currently blocked, so automated run confirmation for the new test could not be completed here.
- `Admin Password Reset Requests` is still a static placeholder page (`/admin/password-reset-requests`); end-to-end organizer reset request workflow is not validated in this pass.
